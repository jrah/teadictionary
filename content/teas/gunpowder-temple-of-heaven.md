  This top quality, robust green tea produces a lovely dark green hue with a
  delightfully light aftertaste. Leaf by leaf, tea has been hand-rolled as tiny
  pearls. Best served hot and paired with a hearty winter meal, though it tastes
  equally delicious iced.
ingredients: pure green tea leaves.
notes: Wonderfully light but distinct flavour. Smooth yet slightly smoky.
guide: >-
  Add one teaspoon Gunpowder Temple of Heaven to one cup of 70-80Â° C water and
  let steep for 20 seconds. To soften the leaves, first rinse with hot water
  then re-infuse.
color: Dark-green
volume: '10.0'
