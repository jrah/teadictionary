  Rooibos is well-known for its cleansing effects. Winter Star Rooibos produces
  a lovely bright red brew. This tea gets its name from Betelgeuse, the ninth
  brightest star in the sky, because of its bright red glow. This luscious,
  caffeine-free blend of Premium Rooibos, Moroccan Almonds, papaya pieces and
  marzipan makes for a full-bodied, sweet herbal tea. So before you wish upon a
  star tonight, brew up a nice warm cup of Winter Star Rooibos ;)
